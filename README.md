# AlgebraManim
Animations for Modern Algebra via the Math Animation Engine

## Vision
These animations should provide simple, clear visual information that helps to
demystify technical, notation-heavy, or otherwise complicated material.

### Topics
1. Algebra in the Complex Plane: complex multiplication, roots of unity, roots of complex numbers
2. Galois Group Elements as Permutions
3. Properties of Algebraic Functions: kernels and images, commutative diagrams
4. Chain Complexes and Exact Sequences
